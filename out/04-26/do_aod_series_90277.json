With Cupid and the Reaper, Volume II of âThe Natureverse,â Chloe will soon learn sheâs not the only super-powered teenager in the world. Meet thirteen-year-old Mondo Ramirez, a hopeless romantic in Savannah, Georgia, who rarely thinks of consequences. When his elaborate 8th grade promposal goes awry, Mondo accidentally kills the Grim Reaper, inheriting the Reaperâs cloak and scythe in the process. Marcus Aronson never accepted or understood his parentsâ divorce. Logical and socially challenged, Marcus went on a mission to find Cupid himself, and finally convinced the winged archer him to hand over his arrows and his title. Armed with research, algorithms and a huge pair of wings, Marcus is determined to change the way people fall in love. Cupid and The Reaper, Volume II of the âNatureverse,â tells the buddy-adventure story of these two mismatched and unlikely heroes. Can Marcus and Mondo learn to work together and harness the powers of life, death and love to fight off a mysterious supernatural force in their school? And will Chloe see them as friends...or foes?

Fast forward a few years, Iâm the 29 year old ex CEO of one of the UKâs fastest growing companies. That company is called Social Chain. My world is intense, sometimes crazy, always challenging and always unpredictable. This podcast is simple, every week Iâm going to share insights with you from guests with different backgrounds, experiences and learnings. I want to give you a look into what itâs like behind the scenes, being an entrepreneur, the deep, dark thoughts that nobody else will share with you and anything else thatâs playing on my mind. This is not scripted and I don't have questions I just see where the conversation takes me. This is the diary of a CEO, Iâm Steven Bartlett. I hope nobody is listening, but if you areâ¦ keep this to yourself.\n\nFOLLOW âº\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/steven/)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/SteveBartlettSC?s=20)\nLinkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbartlett-123/)",
