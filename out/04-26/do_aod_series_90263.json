The book is about her childhood, her growing up, and her becoming an adult; all with mentally ill, drug and alcohol addicted parents, child protection, foster care, caravans and couches. There were crazy and very difficult times but also some funny times too. Rosie is 30 now, her mum Lisa is now 53. Since the book came out, the one question Rosie is always asked is more than any other is, \"Has your Mum read the book?\"\r\n\r\nLisa hadn't read it for a while, because her drinking was so bad that she physically or emotionally couldn't.

Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur âGeniusâ Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\r\n\r\nEach episode dives into one aria â a feature for a single singer â and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\r\n\r\nA wealth of guests â from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like biological anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl â join Rhiannon and the Met Operaâs singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\r\n\r\n Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

I'm proud to say that we've spoken to almost everyone from the original creative team (aka \"The Cabinet\") including the man himself: Lin-Manuel Miranda. In addition, I've had cast members from every company, crew members, musicians, creatives, and the hard working people that keep the production alive. I've also had to pleasure of speaking to experts on the show and its history, some of my superfan friends of note, celebrity Ham enthusiasts, and everything in between.Â \r\n\r\nWhen I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has grown around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast is for you and I absolutely love making it. \r\n\r\nIf you have any great Ham stories or funny references that you've come across, let me know!
