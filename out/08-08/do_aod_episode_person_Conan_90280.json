He needs to hand the keys to Conan OâBrien, who doesnât want to be stuck in the 12:30 slot forever. \r\nAs Lettermanâs ratings at CBS decline, NBC makes a bizarre decision to keep its hosts happy and in the family. Itâs a decision that backfires in every possible way. \r\nThe fallout will spark the last, devastating shake up in the late night wars, as the battlefield goes through radical changes. Technology and taste never sleep, and the networksâand the hostsâare forced to redefine themselves as the industry moves toward the future.\r\nListen to new episodes 1 week early and to all episodes ad free with Wondery+.
