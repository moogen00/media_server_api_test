But murder is just part of the Hodel family story, one filled with horrifying secrets that ripple across generations. Now, through never-before-heard archival audio and first-time interviews, the Hodel family opens up to reveal their shocking story.

Start your free trial at <a href=\"http://wonderyplus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wonderyplus.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>In 1978, Rodney Alcala won a date on the popular TV show, <em>The Dating Game</em>. What no one knew was that he was a prolific serial killer in the middle of a cross-country murder spree. In this six-part series, co-hosts Tracy Pattin (Hollywood &amp; Crime) and Stephen Lang (Avatar, Donât Breathe) take listeners on an unbelievable journey into Alcalaâs twisting secret life. He hid behind normal jobs as a typesetter at a prominent newspaper and a summer camp counselor. How did this predatory monster fool employers, prison psychiatrists, and parole boards â all while committing heinous crimes from coast to coast? And how did a one-time appearance as a game show contestant help lead to his capture? From the makers of Dirty John, Dr. Death, and Young Charlie, learn the story of the most famous serial killer youâve never heard of - The Dating Game Killer.</p>",
