Discussions range from plotting and interpretation to the impact of the beloved adaptations to an attempt at ranking them all. On the weeks in between, we take a breather to discuss one of her many (100-plus) short stories, plays, non-mystery novels, and notable periods in her life.

Due to the wide public interest in the \"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,\" this project started with the belief that quality audio of the report should be available for anyone to hear -- and not hidden behind a paywall or require a subscription.\r\n\r\nFor many of us, reading through the report page-by-page is too time consuming. This is the report, available piece-by-piece, for anyone to access it and listen in manageable portions.\r\n\r\nThis podcast is not affiliated with or connected to the Special Counsel or the investigation.",

Host Eric Molinsky talks with novelists, screenwriters, comic book artists, filmmakers, and game designers about their craft of creating fictional worlds. The show also looks at the fan experience, exploring what makes us suspend our disbelief, and what happens when that spell is broken. Fantasy worlds may be set in distant planets or parallel dimensions, but they are crafted here on Earth and on some level relate to our daily lives. Employing his years of experience in public radio, Eric brings a sophisticated, thoughtfully produced voice to the far-out and fantastical.",
