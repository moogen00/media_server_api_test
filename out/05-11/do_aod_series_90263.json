            "description" : "In this podcast about all things Hamilton, Hamilton-related, Hamilton-adjacent, or anything else in the Miranda universe, I (your host Gillian Pensavalle) talk to guests (and my sometimes co-host/all times husband Michael Paul Smith) about such things as: how Hamilton brings people together, how we find Ham references in everyday life, and the general brilliance of the show. I'm proud to say that we've spoken to almost everyone from the original creative team (aka \"The Cabinet\") including the man himself: Lin-Manuel Miranda. In addition, I've had cast members from every company, crew members, musicians, creatives, and the hard working people that keep the production alive. I've also had to pleasure of speaking to experts on the show and its history, some of my superfan friends of note, celebrity Ham enthusiasts, and everything in between.Â \r\n\r\nWhen I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has grown around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast is for you and I absolutely love making it. \r\n\r\nIf you have any great Ham stories or funny references that you've come across, let me know!
