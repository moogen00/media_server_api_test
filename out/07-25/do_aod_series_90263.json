Through in-depth interviews with authors and thinkers, host Brett McKay finds insights on how men can better understand their culture, their lives, and themselves, and recapture the ancient and classical ideal of manliness, one of arete and eudaimonia: excellence and flourishing.\r\nEpisodes explore how to live a life of both contemplation and action, while having some fun along the way. The show topics cover everything from history and philosophy, to social/professional skills, to parenting, to self-defense and physical training, to pop culture and literature.",

Every month we revisit one of these novels in the order they were first published in the UK. Discussions range from plotting and interpretation to the impact of the beloved adaptations to an attempt at ranking them all. On the weeks in between, we take a breather to discuss one of her many (100-plus) short stories, plays, non-mystery novels, and notable periods in her life. Call it a Christie-fest, as we revisit Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, and oh so much more.... Join us.",

Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\r\n\r\n Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

            "summary" : "Aria Code is a podcast that pulls back the curtain on some of the most famous arias in opera history, with insight from the biggest voices of our time, including Roberto Alagna, Diana Damrau, Sondra Radvanovsky, and many others. Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur âGeniusâ Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\r\n\r\nEach episode dives into one aria â a feature for a single singer â and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\r\n\r\nA wealth of guestsâfrom artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like Dame Judi Dench and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girlâjoin Rhiannon and the Met Operaâs singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\r\n\r\nÂ Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

Host Eric Molinsky talks with novelists, screenwriters, comic book artists, filmmakers, and game designers about their craft of creating fictional worlds.

Fantasy worlds may be set in distant planets or parallel dimensions, but they are crafted here on Earth and on some level relate to our daily lives. Employing his years of experience in public radio, Eric brings a sophisticated, thoughtfully produced voice to the far-out and fantastical.",
