The story follows Austin Lively, a Hollywood wannabe whose career is going nowhere. One day, Austin walks through a door and finds himself transported to a magical land â where, to his shock, he's a suspect in a murder. Before he knows it, he is swept up in palace intrigue, sword fights and sorcery. And to make matters even more complicated, now and then he is carried back to Los Angeles, where he has to find the book â \"Another Kingdom\" â that might explain why all this is happening to him. Unfortunately, a ruthless billionaire also wants the book and is willing to kill anyone who gets in his way â which includes Austin.",

               "description" : "Another Kingdom is a fantasy-suspense yarn by bestselling, two-time Edgar Award-winning crime novelist Andrew Klavan â who also happens to host a popular podcast on the Daily Wire. The story follows Austin Lively, a Hollywood wannabe whose career is going nowhere. One day, Austin walks through a door and finds himself transported to a magical land â where, to his shock, he's a suspect in a murder. Before he knows it, he is swept up in palace intrigue, sword fights and sorcery. And to make matters even more complicated, now and then he is carried back to Los Angeles, where he has to find the book â \"Another Kingdom\" â that might explain why all this is happening to him. Unfortunately, a ruthless billionaire also wants the book and is willing to kill anyone who gets in his way â which includes Austin.",

The Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. The podcast's specific project is to rank these novels--because imposing objectivity on a subjective experience like reading is the sort of fruitless exercise that leads to all sorts of fruitful observations, even revelations. More broadly, the idea is to approach Christie by way of a rigorous literary analysis she so rarely gets, but so richly deserves. The same can be said about the mystery genre overall, which is why episodes about Christie are peppered liberally with interviews of contemporary mystery authors, literary scholars, and others. Call it a Christie-fest, if you will, as we revisit Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, and so much more.",

The Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. The podcast's specific project is to rank these novels--because imposing objectivity on a subjective experience like reading is the sort of fruitless exercise that leads to all sorts of fruitful observations, even revelations. More broadly, the idea is to approach Christie by way of a rigorous literary analysis she so rarely gets, but so richly deserves. The same can be said about the mystery genre overall, which is why episodes about Christie are peppered liberally with interviews of contemporary mystery authors, literary scholars, and others. Call it a Christie-fest, if you will, as we revisit Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, and so much more.",

Host Eric Molinsky spent over a decade working as a public radio reporter and producer, and he uses those skills to create thoughtful, sound-rich episodes about science fiction, fantasy, and other genres of speculative fiction. Every other week, he talks with comic book artists, game designers, novelists, screenwriters, filmmakers, and fans about how they craft their worlds, why we suspend our disbelief, and what happens if the spell is broken. Imaginary worlds may be set on distant planets or parallel dimensions, but they are crafted here on Earth, and theyâre always about us and our lived experiences.",
