Host Eric Molinsky spent over a decade working as a public radio reporter and producer, and he uses those skills to create thoughtful, sound-rich episodes about science fiction, fantasy, and other genres of speculative fiction. Every other week, he talks with comic book artists, game designers, novelists, screenwriters, filmmakers, and fans about how they craft their worlds, why we suspend our disbelief, and what happens if the spell is broken. Imaginary worlds may be set on distant planets or parallel dimensions, but they are crafted here on Earth, and theyâre always about us and our lived experiences.",

The Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. Every month we revisit one of these novels in the order they were first published in the UK. Discussions range from plotting and interpretation to the impact of the beloved adaptations to an attempt at ranking them all. On the weeks in between, we take a breather to discuss one of her many (100-plus) short stories, plays, non-mystery novels, and notable periods in her life. Call it a Christie-fest, as we revisit Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, and oh so much more.... Join us.",

Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur âGeniusâ Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\r\n\r\nEach episode dives into one aria â a feature for a single singer â and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\r\n\r\nA wealth of guests â from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like biological anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl â join Rhiannon and the Met Operaâs singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\r\n\r\n Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",
