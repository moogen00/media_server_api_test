Through in-depth interviews with authors and thinkers, host Brett McKay finds insights on how men can better understand their culture, their lives, and themselves, and recapture the ancient and classical ideal of manliness, one of arete and eudaimonia: excellence and flourishing.\r\nEpisodes explore how to live a life of both contemplation and action, while having some fun along the way. The show topics cover everything from history and philosophy, to social/professional skills, to parenting, to self-defense and physical training, to pop culture and literature.",

            "summary" : "The iFanboy.com Comic Book Podcast is a weekly talk show all about the best new current comic book releases. Lifelong friends, Conor Kilpatrick and Josh Flanagan talk about what they loved and (sometimes) hated in the current weekly books, from publishers like Marvel, DC, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, BOOM! Studios, IDW, Aftershock, Valiant, and more. The aim is to have a fun time, some laughs, but to also really understand what makes comic books work and what doesnât, and trying to understand the craft of this great, often under appreciated art form. Sometimes they agree, and sometimesâ¦ they donât. With decades of experience talking about comics, interacting with comic book professionals, this is all about the love of an art form. If the names Brian Michael Bendis, Amanda Conner, Geoff Johns, Gene Luen Yang, Donny Cates, Jason Aaron, Kelly Thompson, David Marquez, Kelly Sue de Connick, Kieron Gillen, Charles Soule, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Scott Snyder, Tom King, Mitch Gerads, Esad Ribic, Rick Remender, Nick Spencer, John Ridley, Skottie Young, Chip Zdarsky, JÃ¶elle Jones, David F. Walker, Grant Morrison, and Darwyn Cooke get you excited, then this is the place for you. This podcast is so good, you donât even need to read comic books or graphic novels to enjoy it, but itâs a lot better if you do.",
